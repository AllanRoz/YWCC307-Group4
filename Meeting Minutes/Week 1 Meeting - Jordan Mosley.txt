This week we met for the first time and had an hour-long meeting discussing the topic and preparing our research. 
We began to construct the powerpoint based on how we would like to present certain ideas for this topic. Our app 
will be either PennyPals or InvestNest as it will be an app where people can come together as a community, and 
help others on their investors journey. Next week we are going to finish the research and begin to work further 
on the powerpoint. Lastly, I do not know if the leader schedule for the group will still be there after I submit 
this so I am putting it down below as well.
